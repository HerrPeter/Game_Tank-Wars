# Game_Tank-Wars

Overview:
  * This game was a project in my Introduction to Software Development class during my first year of college. The base game was prebuilt with assets provided; the objective was to change/add a meaningful feature to the game. I decided to make the tank smoothly line up to the side of any wall as the player drives into a wall at an angle. The purpose of this was to create a more fluid and immersive player experience as before the tank would bounce off the wall in an erratic manner. The challenge was creating a predictable and reliable collision system. I ultimately used a state mechanism (via enumerators) to achieve this resulting in minimal code.
